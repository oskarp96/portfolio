                <p>My name is Oskar, and I'm a student currently studying my last semester of informatics at Ã–rebro University.
                    I'm passionate about everything that have to do with systems development, but particularly in programming. 
                    Techniques I've gotten especially interested in are .NET (C#), JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS and SQL. Head over to
                    the <Link to="/about">about page</Link> if you wanna know more about me!
